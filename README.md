# Predictive-Maintenance-for-NYC-Subway
## Abstract

New York Cityâ€™s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) boasts the largest subway system in the United States, serving 3.6 million daily riders annually, but it is not without its issues. It is in dire need of infrastructure investments to maintain safe and timely operations. The MTA has published a 20-year Needs Assessment [2] that highlights aging infrastructure, evolving climate change, and increasing ridership as problems that will affect the scale and speed at which the subway needs targeted maintenance. With that in mind, our research investigates novel machine learning techniques to assess the probability of a service disruption type and its expected impact on passenger travel times based on subway line and weather-related factors. After building the respective supervised learning models, we cluster subway lines based on their contribution to network vulnerability using unsupervised learning techniques. This holistic approach to service disruptions will help MTA take more concerted maintenance measures and optimize resources allocation.
